_C0 Ghost Equip
# This code generates a "ghost" version of all the items in each category.
# The items display the amount you have obtained instead of the level (they're always at base level).
# This can also be used with the "full slot unlock" code, and it will load masks on the mask slot.
# The code has no permanent effects.
