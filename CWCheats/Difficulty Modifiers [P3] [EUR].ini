_C0 Difficulty [RESET]
# This code overwrites mission difficulty. It works on default and DLC quests.
# The code must be enabled before entering the mission's loading screen. It won't work otherwise.
# The effects are only temporal. Selecting the difficulty reset code or restarting the game reverts the changes.
# Difficulty is handled locally in multiplayer so in most cases, other players won't be able to see the changes.
